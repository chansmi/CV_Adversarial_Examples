#  Final Project: Testing Adversarial Attacks

### Your name and any other group members, if any.

Bennett Brain and Chandler Smith

### Links/URLs to any videos you created and want to submit as part of your report.


### What operating system and IDE you used to run and compile your code.
With minor tweaks, this system should run on windows or mac, however, the uploaded code is optimized for a mac using VSCode. For testing purposes, using VSCode would be the preferred method. 

Flow:
- Part1.py
- misc_testing.py
- examine_network.py



### Instructions for running your executables.
As long as the appropriate files are included, this code should run mostly untouched. Prior to running the code, however, there are two places where you will need to change the absolute path of the file so it saves correctly.

Depending on the system, change '~/.torch/' for mac and '/files/' for windows on line 24 in misc_testing.py, 


### Whether you are using any time travel days and how many.
None
