### What operating system and IDE you used to run and compile your code.
With minor tweaks, this system should run on windows or mac, however, the uploaded code is optimized for a mac using VSCode. For testing purposes, using VSCode would be the preferred method. 

Flow:
- Part1.py
- misc_testing.py
- examine_network.py
- new_digits_test.py
- Part3.py
- new_greek_test.py
- *Extension* examine_greekNetwork.py
- autoTesting.py - adjust parameters at line 157


### Instructions for running your executables.
As long as the appropriate files are included, this code should run mostly untouched. Prior to running the code, however, there are two places where you will need to change the absolute path of the file so it saves correctly.

Depending on the system, change '~/.torch/' for mac and '/files/' for windows on line 24 in misc_testing.py, 
Change file path on Part3 line 41, 52, and 84


### Instructions for testing any extensions you completed.
 Extensions:
- two_5x5.py
- one_5x5.py
- two_5x5e10.py
- two_3x3.py

- one3x3.py
- three_5x5.py
- two_7x7.py
